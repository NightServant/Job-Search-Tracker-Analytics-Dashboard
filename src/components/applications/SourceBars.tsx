 * HERE. The status tabs sit about a hundred pixels under this card and already
 * print all five counts; a status donut in this slot would be the same five
 * numbers twice on one screen, which is decoration wearing a chart's clothes.
 * Source is the one dimension of an application this screen never shows —
 * the table's columns are company, position, status, salary and applied-on —
 * and "which channel is actually producing these" is a real question to ask
 * while looking at the list. The Overview's `by source` panel names only the
 * top two and a tail; this draws the actual distribution.
 *
 * HORIZONTAL, because the labels are words. `Jobstreet`, `Cloudstaff`,
 * `unknown` set under vertical bars in a third of a row would each be rotated
 * or truncated; along the y axis they are simply read.
