 * closed-set argument survives the rename; the values it named do not.
 *
 * THE CONTROL ITSELF WAS DELETED IN BETWEEN, correctly: for one day `word` and
 * `latex` both returned the same set, and a dropdown whose two options cannot
 * disagree is furniture. It is back because the options disagree again.

 *
 * IT WAS TEN, on a discoverability argument borrowed from /applications: at
 * twenty, somebody with a dozen CVs never sees a pager and cannot tell the
 * list is paged. Five keeps that and buys something else -- the desktop
 * screen opens with the template gallery above this list, and ten rows pushed

 * continues was the part you had to scroll to find.
 *
 * BELOW `lg` THERE IS NO PAGER AT ALL and the list runs to its full length.
 * A phone scrolls; that is what a phone does. Paging a scrolling surface asks

/**
 * The Documents screen, laid out the way Microsoft Word lays out its start
 * screen, at Gabe's instruction: a row of template cards across the top, then
 * the list of documents you already have beneath it.
 *
 * That ordering is the whole idea and it is worth stating why it is right
 * here rather than only in Word. This screen has two jobs -- start something,
 * or reopen something -- and the old layout served only the second, with
 * starting hidden behind one button in the corner. Putting the templates on
 * the page makes the first job visible without a click and gives the empty
 * state something to actually be empty OF.
 *
 * **Where `new document` lives is conditional, deliberately.** With documents
 * on the page it sits in the header, where a page-level action belongs. With
 * none, it does NOT: the empty state already owns the screen and already
 * carries the call to action, and a second identical button in the corner is
 * the same offer made twice, three inches apart. Gabe asked for exactly this.
 *
 * IT IS NOT CALLED `new CV` ANY MORE, because it no longer makes one. It opens
 * the `DocumentChooser`, which asks Curriculum Vitae or Cover Letter, and a
 * button whose label names one of the two things it offers is a button that
 * has already answered half the question on the reader's behalf.
 *
 * `import` sits beside `new document` wherever `new document` is -- header
 * when there are documents, empty state when there are not -- because they are
 * the two ways to get a document into this list and separating them would
 * imply a hierarchy that does not exist.
 *
 * Version history is one row at a time. Loading every CV's snapshots to render
 * a list of CVs would be one query per row for information almost nobody
 * opens, so the caller fetches on demand and this component only says which
 * row asked.
