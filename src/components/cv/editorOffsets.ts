/**
 * Translating GrammarBot's plain-text offsets into ProseMirror positions.
 *
 * THE TWO COORDINATE SYSTEMS ARE NOT THE SAME, and this is the only file that
 * knows it. `editor.getText()` returns a flat string with blocks joined by a
 * separator; ProseMirror addresses the document by position, which counts node
 * boundaries as well as characters. In a CV with a heading and two paragraphs
 * those numbers have already diverged by the end of the first line.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A SEARCH-AND-REPLACE. The obvious shortcut is to take the
 * flagged word and `replace()` the first match. It is wrong on exactly the
 * documents people have: a CV that says "manged" twice fixes the wrong one,
 * and a fix for "and" would hit the first of forty. Offsets identify one
 * occurrence and the mapping has to preserve that.
 *
 * THE SEPARATOR MUST MATCH WHAT WAS SENT. The text handed to the checker and
 * the text measured here are the same string or every offset after the first
 * block boundary is wrong, which is why `BLOCK_SEPARATOR` lives here and both
 * callers take it from this file rather than each passing its own default.
