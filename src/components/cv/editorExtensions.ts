/**
 * What the Word editor can do, in one list.
 *
 * ONE DEFINITION, SHARED WITH THE TESTS, and that is the whole reason this is
 * a module rather than an inline array. The ribbon calls `setFontFamily`,
 * `setTextAlign`, `toggleHighlight` and friends; if the editor under test is
 * built from a different extension set than the real one, those commands are
 * simply absent and the test fails with "not a function" -- which is exactly
 * what happened on 2026-09-11 when the toolbar test still built a StarterKit
 * editor. A shared list makes that impossible: the ribbon is tested against
 * the same capabilities it ships with.
 *
 * STARTERKIT COVERS bold, italic, underline, strike, lists, headings, code,
 * blockquote, horizontal rule and history. EVERYTHING ELSE HERE HAD TO BE
 * ADDED for Word's Home tab -- alignment, font family, font size, colour,
 * highlight, line spacing, sub/superscript. Half the ribbon had nothing to
 * call before them.
 *
 * PINNED TO 3.22.5 to match `@tiptap/core`. The current releases want core
 * 3.31 and npm refuses the graph; upgrading core under a working editor to
 * gain a toolbar is the wrong trade.

/**
 * The `doc` node, taught to carry the page it was imported at.
 *
 * AN ATTRIBUTE ON THE DOCUMENT IS THE ONLY PLACE THIS SURVIVES. The page
 * geometry read out of a .docx has to outlive being typed in and saved, and
 * tiptap re-serialises from the schema -- so a key sitting beside `type:
 * 'doc'` in the JSON is dropped the first time the editor writes it back, and
 * the imported margins would silently revert to the default on the first
 * autosave. Declared here, `getJSON()` returns it intact.
 *
 * `renderHTML` returns nothing for it, because this is geometry for the
 * editor's sheet and not something that belongs in exported markup.

/**
 * The space Word puts above and below a paragraph, carried per block.
 *
 * ONE NUMBER FOR THE WHOLE DOCUMENT WAS NOT ENOUGH, which is the bug these
 * attributes exist for. The imported CV writes eight different `w:after`
 * values -- 0.5pt under a bullet, 4pt between skills lines, 8pt under the
 * contact line -- and rendering the median of them made the skills section
 * half an inch shorter than Word draws it. See lib/pageGeometry.
 *
 * `padding-top` RATHER THAN `margin-top`, AND THAT IS THE POINT. CSS collapses
 * adjacent vertical margins and takes the larger; Word ADDS space-after to the
 * next paragraph's space-before. A bullet closing a section at 0.5pt after,
 * followed by a heading at 6.5pt before, is a 7pt gap in Word and would be a
 * 6.5pt gap in CSS. Padding does not collapse, so the sum survives.
 *
 * `margin-top: 0` GOES WITH IT because the editor's own stylesheet sets a
 * heading margin from the document's heading spacing; without this the two
 * would stack and every section heading would sit at double its gap.
