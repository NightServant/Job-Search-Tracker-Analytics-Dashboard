/**
 * Real page breaks: content is pushed past a boundary, not painted under one.
 *
 * WHY THE BACKGROUND VERSION HAD TO GO. The first attempt drew page edges with
 * a repeating gradient -- first a hairline, then a band of the well's colour to
 * give the "space between" that was asked for. Both are painted BEHIND the
 * text, so where a break fell mid-paragraph the band struck straight through a
 * line of it. Gabe's screenshot has a grey stripe across "Smart Human Resource
 * Management System", and "weird" was the right word: a page boundary that
 * crosses a sentence is not a page boundary, it is a stripe.
 *
 * Nothing about a background can fix that, because the content flows over it
 * regardless. The break has to MOVE the content.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS. Every top-level block is measured, and their heights are
 * accumulated. When the next block would straddle a page edge, a widget
 * decoration is inserted before it, tall enough to fill the remainder of the
 * page plus the gap between sheets -- so the block starts at the top of the
 * next page and the space between is genuinely empty. That is what Word's
 * Print Layout does and why a heading never lands half over a page edge there.
 *
 * BLOCKS ARE MEASURED, NOT ESTIMATED. Line counts, character counts and
 * average line heights all fail on the document that matters: a CV mixes 16pt
 * headings, 11pt body and tight bullet lists, and a guess that is 5% out is a
 * page out by the third page. `offsetHeight` is what the browser actually laid
 * out.
 *
 * IT CONVERGES BECAUSE IT MEASURES BLOCKS, NOT POSITIONS. The naive version --
 * read each block's `offsetTop`, decide breaks, insert spacers, read again --
 * never settles, because inserting a spacer moves everything after it and
 * changes the answer. Accumulating intrinsic block heights and ignoring the
 * spacers gives the same result whether or not decorations are present, so the
 * second pass agrees with the first and it stops.
 *
 * A BLOCK TALLER THAN A PAGE IS LEFT ALONE. A single paragraph longer than a
 * page cannot be made to fit one, and pushing it to the next page would loop:
 * it would not fit there either. It starts where it starts and runs over, which
 * is what Word does with one too.
