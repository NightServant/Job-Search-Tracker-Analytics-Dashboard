/**
 * The Word editor's TipTap document, as a compilable .tex file.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AGAIN, AFTER THE LATEX EDITOR WAS DELETED. Those are two
 * different things and it is worth saying so up front, because the deletion is
 * recent and this file looks like it undoes it. The LaTeX EDITOR was a second
 * authoring surface -- a source pane, its own templates, its own compile
 * round trip -- and it went on 2026-09-13 because two editors for one document
 * kind is two things to keep in step. This is an EXPORT: one function over the
 * document somebody already typed, in the same shape as `docxExport`. Nothing
 * here can be edited, so there is no second surface to drift.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. Gabe, 2026-09-15: "make sure these word documents are able
 * to be exported as LaTeX files without breaking formats." Academic and
 * research applications routinely ask for a .tex source, and a CV that can
 * only leave this app as .docx or PDF is one a postdoc application cannot use.
 *
 * "WITHOUT BREAKING FORMATS" IS THE WHOLE SPECIFICATION, and it has two
 * halves that fail in completely different ways.
 *
 *   IT MUST COMPILE. LaTeX has ten characters that mean something other than
 *   themselves, and a CV is full of four of them -- `&` in "R&D", `%` in "20%
 *   growth", `#` in "C#", `_` in an email or a repo name. An unescaped one is
 *   not a formatting glitch, it is a document that does not build at all. See
 *   `escapeLatex`, which is the most load-bearing function in this file.
 *
 *   IT MUST LOOK LIKE THE SAME DOCUMENT. Every property the editor carries --
 *   the page geometry, the face, the body size, the leading, the paragraph
 *   spacing, the heading sizes and the space around them, the rule under a
 *   section, the alignment, bold and italic and per-run sizes -- has a LaTeX
 *   equivalent, and dropping any of them produces a file that compiles into
 *   something that is not the CV. `docxExport` had exactly this bug twice
 *   (page setup, then the heading rules) and both times the file a recruiter
 *   opened was not the file that was uploaded.
 *
 * IT READS THE SAME THREE SOURCES `docxExport` READS, deliberately: the doc
 * node's `pageGeometry` and `documentTypography`, and the per-block
 * `spaceBefore` / `spaceAfter` / `ruled` / `textAlign`. Those are the
 * contract, not docx's. A property added for one exporter and not the other is
 * how the two outputs start disagreeing about what the document is.
 *
 * IT TARGETS pdfLaTeX AND XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX BOTH, from one file. The preamble
 * branches on the engine exactly once, for the font, because that is the only
 * thing pdfLaTeX genuinely cannot do -- see `fontPreamble`.
 *
 * NO `\\usepackage{hyperref}`, NO COLOUR, NO CUSTOM COMMANDS. Every package
 * below is in a default TeX Live install and does one job the document
 * actually asks for. A .tex that needs something from CTAN before it builds is
 * a .tex that does not build on the machine it was sent to.

 * `\textbackslash{}`. The same for `~` and `^`, which are accents: a bare
 * `\~` expects a letter to put a tilde over and swallows the next character.
 * The `{}` after each command is what stops it eating the following space.
