/**
 * Turns the Word editor's TipTap document into a real .docx.
 *
 * WHY A GENERATOR AND NOT docx-editor.dev's AUTOMATION API. That library's
 * core is Apache-2.0 and fits this app, but it is BROWSER-ONLY and its
 * Office.js-compatible automation API (`@docx-editor.dev/editor-api`) is under
 * the EigenPal Pro Licence at $500/month. Gabe's call was the free editor for
 * editing plus the `docx` package for output, which is what this is: a pure
 * function over the editor's own JSON, no licence and no browser required.
 *
 * WHY .docx AT ALL when the app already exports PDF: ATS parsers still handle
 * Word more reliably than PDF, and a large share of application forms accept
 * .doc/.docx only. A CV that cannot be uploaded is not a CV.
 *
 * IT IS DELIBERATELY PLAIN. No colours, no tables, no text boxes, no columns,
 * no headers or footers -- every one of those is a known ATS parsing hazard,
 * and this file exists to produce something a parser can read rather than
 * something that looks designed. `atsLint` already enforces the same rule on
 * the content side.

/**
 * The document's own face, size and spacing, as Word's DEFAULT STYLES.
 *
 * WHY THE EXPORT HAD TO LEARN THIS (2026-09-15). `documentTypography` has
 * ridden on the doc node since the import started reading it, and the EDITOR
 * has always honoured it -- see WordResumeEditor, which turns it into CSS
 * custom properties on the sheet. This function did not, so the face and the
 * sizes stopped at the screen: a CV imported in Garamond 11pt was edited in
 * Garamond 11pt and exported in Word's own default, which is the round-trip
 * loss `pageGeometry` and `ruled` each already have a paragraph about.
 *
 * It became urgent when the templates started using type to tell themselves
 * apart. Gabe: "CV and Cover Letter templates felt the same. Implement
 * different typography, spacing, and format in every template." Six CVs that
 * differ by face, body size and leading on screen and export as six identical
 * files would be a distinction that exists only in the preview -- and the
 * exported file is the one that reaches an employer.
 *
 * DEFAULT STYLES, NOT PER-RUN PROPERTIES, and that is the important half. Word
 * resolves a run with no explicit font to the document default, so setting it
 * here means every paragraph inherits -- including paragraphs the person types
 * later. Writing the face onto each run instead would freeze the document at
 * the template's choice and make "select all, change font" a no-op on
 * everything already there.
 *
 * THE UNITS ARE WORD'S AND EACH ONE IS DIFFERENT:
 *   `size`   half-points. 11pt is 22.
 *   `line`   240ths of a line, where 240 is single spacing.
 *   `before` / `after`  twips, at 20 to the point.
 * Getting any of them wrong produces a document that is subtly, unfixably off
 * rather than obviously broken, which is why they are named here.
 *
 * NULLS FALL THROUGH, which is what keeps this safe for every document that
 * predates it. `normalizeTypography` returns all-null for a document with no
 * typography, every branch below is conditional, and a `styles.default` with
 * no properties in it is what Word already does.
