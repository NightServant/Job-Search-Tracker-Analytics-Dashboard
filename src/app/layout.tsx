 * scale sets weights and `font-synthesis: none` forbids a faked bold.

/**
 * No custom domain is registered for this project yet -- `VERCEL_URL` is the
 * per-deployment host Vercel injects automatically (preview and production
 * alike), so metadataBase tracks wherever this actually deploys rather than
 * a fabricated domain. Falls back to localhost for `next dev`/tests, where
 * the var is unset.
 *
 * `icons` is deliberately absent: icon.svg / apple-icon.png / favicon.ico /
 * opengraph-image.png in this directory are Next 15's file-convention names,
 * and Next generates the <link rel="icon"> etc. tags from them on its own --
 * hand-writing `icons` here would just be a second, driftable source of truth.
 *
 * `description` stays a sentence fragment, lowercase chrome under the item-10
 * rule ("Worktrack" itself is the product's proper noun and keeps its case).
 * `openGraph.description` reuses the sidebar footer's retired M5 line rather
 * than inventing a tagline; `CV` keeps its case as an acronym.
